# AI Tech Support Assistant

This project is a web-based AI tech support tool created during a hackathon. It’s a React app that connects to an AI backend (using the Gemini API) to help users troubleshoot technical issues through a simple chat interface.

## Objective

The goal was to create a tool that could assist people, especially those less familiar with technology, by offering two distinct support modes:

- **Definition AI**: Gives direct technical answers quickly, similar to typical AI assistants.
- **Tech Support AI**: Offers step-by-step troubleshooting guidance to walk users through solving problems in a simpler, more digestible way.

## Features

- Switch between two AI assistant modes (instant vs. guided help)
- Text input and chatbot-style interface
- Simple mode toggle and tabbed UI layout
- AI response display with basic HTML formatting
- Placeholder for future video tutorials section

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** – For the frontend UI
- **Axios** – For making API calls to the backend
- **CSS** – For basic layout and styling
- **Gemini API** – For generating AI responses (via backend API)

## Current Status

The application is a working prototype but not a finished product. The interface is basic, and some features, like the video tutorial section,n are not yet implemented. Despite this, the project served as a valuable hands-on learning experience.

## What I Learned

- How to integrate third-party APIs into a React app
- Structuring a multi-mode UI with conditionally rendered components
- Handling async requests and formatting dynamic content
- Managing state cleanly across different UI modes
- The importance of designing tools that are user-friendly for a non-technical audience

## Hackathon Reflection

This project was built under time constraints during a hackathon. While it isn’t polished, it laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of API integrations, UI design, and AI-assisted problem solving. It also inspired me to take on more complex projects afterward.
